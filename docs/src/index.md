# Application Module Library Docs

Welcome to the Application Module Library documentation! :wave:

Application Module Library (modlib) is an SDK designed to simplify and streamline the process of creating **end-to-end** applications for the **IMX500 vision sensor**. Whether you're just getting started, a seasoned developer or a product expert. Modlib provides the tools and abstractions you need to bring your ideas to life, quickly! 

We're excited to see what you'll create. Let's get started! :rocket:

:::note  
The Application Module Library is still a young project and very much a work in progress. We're continuously extending and improving the library and our content to provide you with the most accurate information. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out or file an issue on Github!
